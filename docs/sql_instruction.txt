setup mysql command for Windows' cmd:
1. open your windows command prompt
2. enter "pathman /au c:\laragon\bin\mysql\mysql-5.7.24-winx64\bin"
3. to check if it is added, type "echo %PATH%"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
if you dont want to do the above setup then do the following process,
Access your sql from Laragon Window or access via CMD (if you set path for it),
at the very first times access mysql via command:
 > mysql -u root -p
 the password will be empty, so you just keep pressing Enter to go to mySL

 -----------------------------------------------------------
 In case you want to set the password for your root account, there are 2 ways for it.
 method 1:
 - after went into mySQL already , enter the following command
 > ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<Enter_your_password_here>';
 method 2:
 - exit mySQL if you were in it.
 - from Laragon's terminal or Windows' cmd, Enter the following command
 > mysql_secure_installation
 - then follow the instruction of mySQL itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------
after finish setting up for mySQL, get into it and run the following command

source c:/laragon/www/fcstudenttracking/database_setup.sql

----

another way is copy and paste one by one from sql file into your command windows.
